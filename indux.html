       <h1 class="padding">Abu Nasr Al-Farabi</h1>
        <p>Abu Nasr Muhammad al-Farabi was one the earliest Islamic intellectuals who
        was instrumental in transmitting the doctrines of Plato and Aristotle to the Muslim world.
        He had a considerable influence on the later Islamic philosophers such as Avicenna.

        He was an outstanding linguist who translated the Greek works of Aristotle and Plato and made considerable
        additions to them of his own.
        He earned the nickname Mallim-e-Sani, which is translated as “second master” or “second teacher”.</p>
        <h2 class="BGROUND FOUNT">Early</h2>
        <p>Al-Farabi completed his earlier education at Farab and Bukhara. Later on he went to Baghdad for higher
        studies where he studied and worked for a long time. During this period he acquired mastery of several
        languages as well as various branches of knowledge and technology. Farabi contributed considerably to 
        science, philosophy, logic, sociology, medicine, mathematics and music. His major contributions were 
        in philosophy, logic and sociology and for which he stands out as an Encyclopedist.

        </p>
        <h2 class="BGROUND FOUNT">Contributions and Achievements:</h2>
        As a philosopher, Farabi was the first to separate philosophy from theology. It is difficult to find a
        philosopher both in Muslim and Christian world from Middle Ages onwards who has not been influenced by
        his views. He believed in a Supreme Being who had created the world through the exercise of balanced 
        intelligence. He also asserted this same rational faculty to be the sole part of the human being that 
        is immortal, and thus he set as the paramount human goal the development of that rational faculty. He 
        gave considerably more attention to political theory compared to any Islamic philosopher.
        
        Later in his work, Farabi laid down in Platonic fashion the qualities necessary for the ruler. He stated 
        that a ruler should be inclined to rule by a good quality of a native character and exhibit the right 
        attitude for such rule. At the heart of Al-Farabi’s political philosophy is the concept of happiness,
        in which people cooperate to gain contentment. He followed the Greek example and the highest rank of
        happiness was allocated to his ideal sovereign whose soul was ‘united as it were with the Active Intellect’
        . Farabi served as a tremendous source of aspiration for intellectuals of the middle ages and made enormous contributions to the knowledge of his day, paving the way for the later philosopher and thinkers of the Muslim world.
        
        Farabian epistemology has both a Neoplatonic and an Aristotelian dimension. The best source for Farabi’s
        classification of knowledge is his Kitab ihsa al-ulum. This work neatly illustrates Farabi’s beliefs,
        both esoteric and exoteric. Through all of them runs a primary Aristotelian stress on the importance 
        of knowledge. Thus al-Farabi’s epistemology, from what has been described may be said to be encyclopedic
        in range and complex in articulation, using both a Neoplatonic and an Aristotelian voice.
        
        Farabi also participated in writing books on early Muslim sociology and a notable book on music titled 
        Kitab al-Musiqa (The Book of Music). This book is, in reality, a study of the theory of Persian music of 
        his day, although in the West it has been introduced as a book on Arab music. He invented several musical 
        instruments, besides contributing to the knowledge of musical notes. It has been reported that he could 
        play his instrument so well as to make people laugh or weep at will. Farabi’s treatise Meanings of the 
        Intellect dealt with music therapy, where he discussed the therapeutic effects of music on the soul.
        <p></p>
       <h2 class="BGROUND FOUNT"> Later Life:</h2>
        <p>Farabi traveled to many distant lands throughout his life and gained many experiences. As a result,
        he made many contributions for which he is still remembered and acknowledged. Despite facing many 
        hardships he worked with full dedication and made his name among the popular scientists of history.
        He died a bachelor in Damascus in 339 A.H. /950 A.D. at the age of 80 years.</p>
        <h1 class="padding">Omar Khayyam Lived 1048 – 1131.</h1>
        <p> In the year 1072 AD, Omar Khayyam documented the most accurate year length ever calculated – a figure still<br> accurate enough for most purposes in the modern world. Khayyam was an astronomer, astrologer, physician, philosopher, and mathematician: he made outstanding contributions in algebra. His poetry is better known in the West than any other non-Western poet.
                
        The man himself remains something of an enigma. Different biographers have documented him as a fun-loving, wine-drinking agnostic; a closet Zoroastrian; a Sufi Muslim; an orthodox Sunni Moslem; and a follower of Ancient Greek philosophy. All agree that he was an outstanding intellectual.
                
        Advertisements</p><br>
        <h2 class="BGROUND FOUNT">Beginnings</h2>
        <p>Omar Khayyam was born on May 18, 1048 in the great trading city of Nishapur in northern Persia.
        Today the city is in Iran. Omar’s father was Ebrahim Khayyami, a wealthy physician. Omar’s
        mother’s name is not known. Some authors have written that Omar’s father earned a living making tents because Khayyami means tent-maker. However, although many English-speakers are named Smith, it does not mean their fathers spent their days hammering hot metal on an anvil.

        Omar’s family were Muslims. His father seems to have been relaxed about religion, 
        employing a mathematician by the name of Bahmanyar bin Marzban, a devotee of the ancient
        Persian religion of Zoroastrianism, to tutor Omar. Bahmanyar had been a student of the 
        great physician, scientist, and philosopher Avicenna, and he gave Omar a thorough education
        in science, philosophy, and mathematics. Khawjah al-Anbari taught Omar astronomy, guiding 
        him through Ptolemy’s Almagest.
                    
        In his early teens Omar worked in his father’s surgery learning about medicine.
                    
        Omar Khayyam celebrated his eighteenth birthday in 1066. In the same year, Halley’s comet 
        appeared in the heavens, William the Conqueror’s Norman Army invaded England, and Omar’s 
        father Ebrahim died. A few months after Ebrahim’s death, Omar’s tutor Bahmanyar also died.
                    
        It was the end of an era in Omar Khayyam’s life. It was time to put his family’s affairs in 
        order and move on.
                    
        Samarkand
        Omar Khayyam joined one of the regular caravans making a three month journey from Nishapur to 
        the great city of Samarkand, which is now in Uzbekistan. Samarkand was a center of scholarship,
        and Khayyam arrived there probably in 1068, aged 20.
        In Samarkand he made contact with his father’s old friend Abu Tahir, who was governor and chief 
        judge of the city. Tahir, observing Khayyam’s extraordinary talent with numbers, gave him a job 
        in his office. Soon Khayyam was given a job in the king’s treasury.
        While living in Samarkand, Khayyam made a major advance in algebra.</p>
        <h2 class="BGROUND FOUNT">Omar Khayyam’s Contributions to Science</h2><br>
        <center><img src="34.png" alt=""></center>
        <P style="color: rgb(41, 5, 75);font-family:Eras Bold ITC;font-size: 25px;">Algebra</P>
        <p><hr>At high school we learn about equations of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0; these are called quadratic 
        equations. Cubic equations are of the form ax3 + bx2 + cx + d = 0. Naturally, cubic equations are harder
        to solve than quadratics.</hr>

         Khayyam conjectured correctly that it is not possible to solve cubic equations using the traditional
         Ancient Greek geometrical tools of straightedge and compass. Other methods are required.
            
        At the age of 22, in 1070, Khayyam published one of his greatest works: Treatise on Demonstration of 
        Problems of Algebra and Balancing. In it he showed that a cubic equation can have more than one solution.
        He also showed how the intersections of conic sections such as parabolas and circles can be utilized to 
        yield geometric solutions of cubic equations. Archimedes had actually started work in this field over a
        thousand years earlier, when he considered the specific problem of finding the ratio of the volume of
        one part of a sphere to another. Khayyam considered the problem in a more general, methodical way.
            
        Khayyam Parabola
        
       
            
        Khayyam’s solutions avoided negative coefficients and negative roots because negative numbers were not
        acknowledged in Islamic mathematics. (Some cultures, however, had incorporated negative numbers into 
        mathematics – for example Brahmagupta had introduced negative numbers into Indian mathematics 400 years
        earlier.)
            
        Although Khayyam’s achievement was magnificent, he was personally disappointed that he needed to utilize 
        geometry to solve cubic equations – he had hoped to discover an algorithm using only algebra.
            
            
        Treatise on Demonstration of Problems of Algebra and Balancing established Khayyam as a mathematician of the
        first rank, and his reputation spread quickly throughout Persia.
        Following Khayyam’s breakthrough there was little significant progress on cubic equations until 1535, 
        when Niccolo Tartaglia found general solutions for all cubic equations.
        Khayyam’s algebra was not the system of letters and signs we use today. His algebra was expressed in words.
        So, where today we write:
            
        Solve for x:
        x2 + 6 = 5x Khayyam wrote: What is the amount of a square so that when 6 dirhams are added to it, 
        it becomes equal to five roots of that square?<p></p>
        <h2 class="BGROUND FOUNT">Linking Algebra and Geometry</h2> 
        <p>(Algebra and Geometry were successfully linked by Pierre de Fermat and René Descartes in the 1600s, 
        resulting in the modern x-y coordinate system.

        Khayyam’s work with cubics had made him certain that algebra and geometry were linked, and he cited
        Euclid’s Elements to support the idea:)</p><br>
       <center><img src="alj.jpg" width="800" height="400"></center> 
        <h2 class="BGROUND FOUNT">Length of Year</h2>
        <p>In 1073, Khayyam received an invitation to the Persian city of Isfahan, capital of the Seljuk Empire,
        to prepare a calendar that would work in an orderly way and be accurate forever – this was an era in
        which year lengths were regularly changed.

        Khayyam’s invitation came from the two most powerful men in the Seljuk Empire, of which Persia was part:
        these were Malik Shah, Sultan of the empire, and Nizam al-Mulk, his vizier.
        
        Khayyam recruited other talented scientists to accompany him to Isfahan in 1074. There he was paid an
        extraordinarily high salary and enjoyed a privileged lifestyle. Malik Shah paid Khayyam to found an 
        observatory with an initial aim of making observations of the heavens for 30 years, during which 
        time Saturn, the most distant planet then known, would complete an orbit.</p>

        <h1 class="padding FOUNT">Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi</h1>
        <p><strong>Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi</strong> was a Persian mathematician, astronomer, astrologer geographer and
        a scholar in the House of Wisdom in Baghdad. He was born in Persia of that time around 780.
        <strong>Al-Khwarizmi</strong> was one of the learned men who worked in the House of Wisdom. 
        <strong>Al-Khwarizmi</strong> flourished while working as a member of the House of Wisdom in Baghdad under 
        the leadership of Kalif al-Mamun, the son of the Khalif Harun al-Rashid, who was made famous 
        in the Arabian Nights. The House of Wisdom was a scientific research and teaching center.</p>
        <h2 class="BGROUND FOUNT">Contributions and Achievements:</h2>
        <p><strong>Al-Khwarizmi</strong> developed the concept of the algorithm in mathematics (which is a reason for his being 
        called the grandfather of computer science by some people).
        <strong>Al-Khwarizmi</strong>’s algebra is regarded as the foundation and cornerstone of the sciences. To al-Khwarizmi we
        owe the world “algebra,” from the title of his greatest mathematical work, Hisab al-Jabr wa-al-Muqabala.
        The book, which was twice translated into Latin, by both Gerard of Cremona and Robert of Chester in the
        12th century, works out several hundred simple quadratic equations by analysis as well as by geometrical
        example. It also has substantial sections on methods of dividing up inheritances and surveying plots of 
        land. It is largely concerned with methods for solving practical computational problems rather than
        algebra as the term is now understood.
            
        <strong>Al-Khwarizmi</strong> confined his discussion to equations of the first and second degrees. He also wrote an
         important work on astronomy, covering calendars, calculating true positions of the sun, moon and planets, 
         tables of sines and tangents, spherical astronomy, astrological tables, parallax and eclipse calculations,
          and visibility of the moon. His astronomical work, Zij al-sindhind, is also based on the work of other 
          scientists. As with the Algebra, its chief interest is as the earliest Arab work still in existence in
           Arabic.
            
        His most recognized work as mentioned above and one that is so named after him is the mathematical concept
         Algorithm. The modern meaning of the word relates to a specific practice for solving a particular problem. 
         Today, people use algorithms to do addition and long division, principles that are found in
          <strong>Al-Khwarizmi</strong>’s
          text written about 1200 years ago. Al-Khwarizmi was also responsible for introducing the Arabic
           numbers to the West, setting in motion a process that led to the use of the nine Arabic numerals,
            together with the zero sign.
            
        Of great importance also was <strong>Al-Khwarizmi</strong>’s contribution to medieval geography. He systematized and 
        corrected Ptolemy’s research in geography, using his own original findings that are entitled as Surat 
        al-Ard (The Shape of the Earth). The text exists in a manuscript; the maps have unfortunately not been
         preserved, although modern scholars have been able to reconstruct them from <strong>Al-Khwarizmi</strong>’s descriptions.
          He supervised the work of 70 geographers to create a map of the then “known world”. When his work became
           known in Europe through Latin translations, his influence made a permanent mark on the development of
            science in the West.
            
        <strong>Al-Khwarizmi</strong> made several important improvements to the theory and construction of sundials, which he 
        inherited from his Indian and Hellenistic predecessors. He made tables for these instruments which 
        considerably shortened the time needed to make specific calculations. His sundial was universal and could 
        be observed from anywhere on the Earth. From then on, sundials were frequently placed on mosques to
         determine the time of prayer. The shadow square, an instrument used to determine the linear height of 
         an object, in conjunction with the alidade for angular observations, was also invented by
          <strong>Al-Khwarizmi</strong>
          in ninth-century Baghdad.
